 `CDAResourcesViewController` is designed to make it easy to display a list of Resources in a table view.
 
 It will automatically request the data from a Space you specify with a query you define once it is
 visible on screen. Additionally, it provides a mapping for selecting which Fields to display in the
 cells of the table view.
