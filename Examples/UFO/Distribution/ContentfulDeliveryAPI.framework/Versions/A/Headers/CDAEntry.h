/**
 *  Copy a set of Field values from this Entry to any custom object you provide. The mapping is

 *
 *  This can be used as a quick way to fill your own value objects with data from Entries fetched 
 *  from the Contentful API, e.g. if you want to use Core Data in your app.
 *
 *  Currently, this method does no conversion or error checking on top of what is already provided by
 *  Key-Value-Coding. However, it will skip all relations to other Resources, because those will
 *  likely need special behaviour.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *      `[someEntry mapFieldsToObject:someObject usingMapping:@{ @"fields.name": @"name" }];
 *
 *  @param object     The target object which is supposed to be filled with data.
 *  @param dictionary A dictionary described the mapping between keypaths on the Entry and 
 *      keypaths on the `object` parameter.
 *
 *  @return To make one line mappings possible, this method returns the `object` parameter.
